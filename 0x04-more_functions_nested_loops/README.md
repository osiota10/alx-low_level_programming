# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project.
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden.
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
- You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account.
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file

# Task
### 0. isupper
Write a function that checks for uppercase character.
- Prototype: `int _isupper(int c);`

### 1. isdigit
Write a function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`).
- Prototype: `int _isdigit(int c);`

- You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code
- File: `3-print_numbers.c`


### 4. I believe in numbers and signs
Write a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: `void more_numbers(void);`
- You can only use `_putchar` three times in your code
- File: `5-more_numbers.c`


### 6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
- Prototype: `void print_line(int n);`
- You can only use `_putchar` function to print
- Where `n` is the number of times the character `_` should be printed
- The line should end with a `\n`
- If `n` is `0` or less, the function should only print `\n`
- File: `6-print_line.c`


### 7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe
Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
- Prototype: `void print_diagonal(int n);`
- You can only use `_putchar` function to print
- Where `n` is the number of times the character `\` should be printed
- The diagonal should end with a `\n`
- If `n` is `0` or less, the function should only print a `\n`
- File: `7-print_diagonal.c`


### 8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch
Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `void print_square(int size);`
- You can only use `_putchar` function to print
- Where `size` is the size of the square
- If `size` is `0` or less, the function should print only a new line
- Use the character `#` to print the square
- File: `8-print_square.c`


### 9. Fizz-Buzz
The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.

Write a program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

- Each number or word should be separated by a space
- You are allowed to use the standard library
```
julien@ubuntu:~/0x04$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 9-fizz_buzz.c -o 9-fizz_buzz
julien@ubuntu:~/0x04$ ./9-fizz_buzz 
1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz Fizz 22 23 Fizz Buzz 26 Fizz 28 29 FizzBuzz 31 32 Fizz 34 Buzz Fizz 37 38 Fizz Buzz 41 Fizz 43 44 FizzBuzz 46 47 Fizz 49 Buzz Fizz 52 53 Fizz Buzz 56 Fizz 58 59 FizzBuzz 61 62 Fizz 64 Buzz Fizz 67 68 Fizz Buzz 71 Fizz 73 74 FizzBuzz 76 77 Fizz 79 Buzz Fizz 82 83 Fizz Buzz 86 Fizz 88 89 FizzBuzz 91 92 Fizz 94 Buzz Fizz 97 98 Fizz Buzz

- Use the character `#` to print the triangle
- File: `10-print_triangle.c`


### 11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic
The prime factors of `1231952` are `2`, `2`, `2`, `2`, `37` and `2081`.

Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line.
